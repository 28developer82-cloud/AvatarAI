| Feature | AvatarAI Assistant | ChatGPT |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Real‑time web access | Can perform live searches and retrieve up‑to‑date information from the internet. | No built‑in live web browsing (knowledge limited to its training cut‑off). |
| Personality | Presented as “AvatarAI Assistant,” a distinct name and persona. | Usually referred to simply as “ChatGPT.” |
| Integration | Designed to respond to commands like `GoogleSearch(...)` for on‑the‑fly queries. | Relies on pre‑trained knowledge; external plugins are optional. |
| Scope of knowledge | Combines its base model with current internet data for the latest facts. | Knowledge static up to its last training date (e.g., 2023‑2024). |
| Customization | Tailored to answer in short, direct style per developer instructions. | Can be configured for various tones, but defaults to a more conversational style. |
| Availability | Intended to act as a real‑time assistant with up‑to‑date info. | Primarily a conversational AI without live data unless paired with external tools. |
In short, AvatarAI Assistant adds live web search capability and a specific concise response style, while ChatGPT is a general‑purpose conversational model without built‑in real‑time browsing.
